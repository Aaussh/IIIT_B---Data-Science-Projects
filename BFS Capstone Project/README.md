# Loan Application Score Card

-- This capstone project was co-developed in a team of 4 where using past data of the bankâ€™s applicants, we accomplished following tasks:
      1. Determined the factors affecting credit risks.
      2. Identified the right customers using predictive models.
      3. Created strategies to mitigate the acquisition risk.
      
-- Following the above analysis and prediction, we finally built an application scorecard with the good to bad odds of 10 to 1 at a score of 400 doubling every 20 points.

-- Lastly we assessed the financial benefits of our project where the results turned out to be pretty positive & accurate and also the submitted insights were fairly actionable.
